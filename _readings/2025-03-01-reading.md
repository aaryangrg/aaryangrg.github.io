### [Why AI will save the world - Marc Andreessen](https://pmarca.substack.com/p/why-ai-will-save-the-world)

- **Baptists vs. Bootleggers in AI**: The AI regulation debate follows a familiar pattern—moral arguments from **Baptists**, self-interest from **Bootleggers**.
- **Baptists**: Argue for AI restrictions on ethical, security, or social grounds. Just as religious activists pushed for Prohibition to curb alcohol’s harms, they see AI as a threat that requires strict controls. Their concerns are real—AI can generate misinformation, disrupt jobs, and challenge governance.
- **Bootleggers**: Support regulation, not to prevent harm, but to **eliminate competition**. During Prohibition, bootleggers thrived because legal alcohol disappeared. In AI, dominant players benefit when **governments restrict open-source models**, ensuring only a few companies control development.
- **Baptists who are also Bootleggers**: AI safety advocates and regulators can be **both**. Some genuinely believe in guardrails, but also stand to gain—whether through **AI safety jobs, research funding, or influence over policy**. Limiting AI development secures their own relevance.
- **Regulation as Market Control**: Governments might **lock down AI research**, citing risks of misuse. Open-source advancements could be curbed under the pretext of national security, concentrating power in **a handful of corporations**. The result? A tightly controlled AI industry where compliance, not innovation, determines who builds the future.

### [AWS - Acquired Podcast (Continued)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APvj15_YCqk)

- **The Myth of Excess Capacity**: A common theory suggests AWS emerged to monetize Amazon’s excess server capacity outside Q4. But this falls apart—what would Amazon do in peak season? Plus, DEC servers had **80% margins**, making excess capacity unlikely in the first place.

- **The Tim O’Reilly Pitch**: Another theory credits Tim O’Reilly for the AWS idea—doing business with thousands of companies **without formal contracts**. Amazon’s first API opened access to its **entire product catalog**, enabling revenue-sharing instead of traditional BD deals.

- **Andy Jassy’s Retention & Role Creation**: When Amazon’s entire marketing department was disbanded, most executives left. However, Jeff Bezos personally retained Andy Jassy, creating a new role for him as **Technical Assistant**—a position that had never existed before. This role placed Jassy in Bezos’s **inner circle**, allowing him to influence Amazon’s long-term **infrastructure strategy** directly.

- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Instead of relying on program management (like Microsoft), Amazon made **all internal data API-accessible** from day one. Every service was built externally, formalized in **Andy Jassy’s six-page memo** advocating infrastructure externalization for speed and efficiency.

- **The Network Infrastructure Memo**: Benjamin Black and his boss wrote an internal memo not just to optimize Amazon’s network but to **sell infrastructure to third parties**. Meanwhile, Chris Pinkham independently built AWS components in South Africa.

- **Core AWS Services**: Amazon identified four key pillars for scalable development—**Storage, Compute, Databases, and CDNs**. They hired **57 top engineers** (future CEOs of **Tableau and Twilio**) and launched services in order: **S3 → EC2 → CloudFront → RDS**.

- **Execution Over Ideation**: AWS wasn’t a **single stroke of genius** but a sequence of **micro-decisions**. Andy Jassy’s **relentless execution** turned AWS into a dominant business unit.

- **AWS and the Shift in Software Development**: Hackathons became viable because AWS provisioned infrastructure **instantly**. Netflix migrated to AWS, despite competing with Amazon in video streaming. Traditional enterprise players (**IBM, Oracle, DEC**) ran on **80% margins**—AWS disrupted them with **pay-per-use at 30% margins**. **IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)** let companies adopt **state-of-the-art hardware** without waiting for refresh cycles.

- **Enterprise Database Lock-In**: Moving enterprise databases is hard, making vendor lock-in inevitable. Amazon tackled this with **Snowball & Snowmobile**—secure physical storage devices avoiding internet transfers. Even with these, Amazon’s **own migration from Oracle took 13 years**, finishing in 2019.

- **AWS’s Edge in ML**: AWS doesn’t need the best ML models—it wins because **data stickiness** ensures customers run ML **where their data is stored**.

- **AWS’s Biggest Failure: Data Warehousing**: AWS **should have dominated** data warehousing, but instead, **Snowflake became a $50B company**—a major missed opportunity.

- **The Two-Pizza Team Problem**: Amazon’s **small, independent teams** drove innovation but also **flooded AWS with too many services**, many of which are rarely used.

- **AWS’s Growing Profitability**: **Operating profit margins jumped from 19% to 30%**, thanks to economies of scale. **AWS generates more gross income than Amazon’s retail business**, making it the company’s most profitable division.

### [How to sell like Steve Jobs - Founders Podcast (Continued)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k72aCBm7Jpk)

- **Adding context to numbers makes them more persuasive**: Steve didn’t just say Apple had **5% market share** in PCs—he put it into context. He explained that **5% market share** was **larger** than BMW or Mercedes’ share in the car industry. What's wrong with being **BMW or Mercedes**?
- **Steve on why unconventional words work**:

  > People forget that audiences want to be both **informed and entertained**.

- **Steve and Charlie Munger aligned on more ideas than one**:

  - Both believed in the **power of unconventionality**.
  - Both understood that **social proof drives sales**.

- **Steve had a 90:1 practice-to-performance ratio**: He rehearsed **so much** that he once arrived **4 hours late** to an interview—because he was still **practicing for his presentation**.
- **Steve on sales**: The **only thing that mattered**. And you can only sell something if you have **absurd belief in it**.

### [Blockchain Governance - MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series(Contd)]()

- **Rule by law vs. Rule of law**: Rule **by** law means using the law as a tool to impose control, often favoring those in power. Rule **of** law ensures that all individuals, regardless of status, are equally subject to the law, with no exceptions.
- **Rule by code vs. Rule of code**: Traditional tech companies operate under **rule by code**, setting their own policies while remaining subject to government jurisdiction. Blockchains, in contrast, claim to follow **rule of code**—once a smart contract is deployed, it **always executes as written**, without intervention. However, in practice, blockchains are not truly rule of code because they rely on **off-chain components** (e.g., oracles, exchanges) that introduce centralized control, making them partially **rule by law**.
- **Decentralization & law enforcement**: Centralized platforms can **easily enforce laws**—they control what actions are allowed and can ban or penalize users. Similarly governments can hold platform owners accountable for activity undertaken on their platform (telegram). **Decentralized systems pose a challenge**

  - Who is responsible for illegal actions? The **participants, the contract creator, or the network itself**?
  - Even if responsibility is assigned, **identifying off-chain identities** is difficult due to **pseudonymity**.

- **Legal precedents**: Despite these challenges, courts have **held blockchain entities accountable**:
  - **Silk Road**: While the platform was anonymous, it was **not decentralized**. Its founder, **Ross Ulbricht**, was identified, tried, and convicted.
  - **Ooki DAO**: A decentralized entity, but courts ruled its members formed an **unincorporated association**—meaning **joint liability** applied. This set a precedent: **DAO members can be sued as individuals** if the DAO lacks legal structure.
